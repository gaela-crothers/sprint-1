<h1>The command line</h1>
The command line (a.k.a terminal, shell, prompt) is another way of interacting with your computer. Instead of working with windows, toolbars, menus, and buttons, you're just interacting with text.
<br>
You perform actions by writing commands, and you get your information back from the computer in the form of text.</p>
